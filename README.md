# angular-multi-tenant-ui-architecture-poc
A multi-tenant Angular UI powered by config-driven architecture and NgRx. Each client gets dynamic branding, features, routes, and profile fieldsâ€”all controlled via JSON. Includes route guards, dynamic navbar, and minimal styling inspired by Uber. Built as a real-world POC.
